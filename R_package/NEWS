NEWS/ChangeLog for BRIDES 1.2.1 (7-09-2020)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Created the R package version on CRAN

* Added BRIDES evaluation of network scenarios (runmode): "exhaustive", "genetics" and "stepwise"
  Those scenarios evaluate successive addition of nodes from augmented network Y, from the 
  network X, in order to MAXIMIZE the BRIDES score using a scoring function.
  
* Added the wt parameter to the BRIDES function to set a scoring strategy for the BRIDES statistics.
* Added the min_additionnal and max_additionnal nodes to the BRIDES function. 
* Added the path_information parameter to the BRIDES function to save the traversed path information.
* Added the mutationChance parameter to the BRIDES function to control the genetics algorithm scenario.
* Added the legend_position parameter to the plot_network function.

CHANGES

* Added Cindy Bouchard (PhD student, UdeM) to the author list.
* Changed the default behavior so that weighted edges are taken into account.
* Added a save network function.
* Fixed some path that were not displayed correcly in the traces in the R version.
* Various fixed to the output of the BRIDES functions.
* Fixed some error in the directed network evaluation.
* Added various warnings in the R code.
* Correction to the C code.
