\name{info_network}
\alias{info_network}
\title{returns additional information regarding the networks X and Y (original and augmented).}
\description{This function returns some additional information such as number of nodes and edges in the networks X and Y.}
\usage{info_network(g1,g2, attributes)}
\arguments{
	\item{g1}{the original network X}
    \item{g2}{the augmented network Y with additional nodes (all the original nodes from X must be present in the augmented network Y)}
    \item{attributes}{the attributes}
}

\value{Additional information such as: number of nodes in networks X and Y, clustering coefficient, average degree, number of clusters and node distributions.}
